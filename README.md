### This is a very short text about the IODS course

The topics of this course contains different methods about data processing e.g. regression, model validation and classification. The topics will be discussed in lectures and each week there are few exercises that need to be done to pass the course. Students must write a course diary and update it every week in their GitHub page.

[Here](https://veeranen.github.io/IODS-project/) is the link to my course diary!
